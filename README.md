# Basic-Java-Genetic-Algorithm
Display competency in Java as a whole with a genetic algorithm demo

The game is Space Invaders.
Basically, I created a bunch of situations that AI will recognize, 
and they will make decisions on what movements to make based on 
their genetics. These genetics will alter after each generation
perishes, with the most successful AI passing its genetics to 
the next generation with slight mutations occuring to continuously 
refine the brain of each AI.
